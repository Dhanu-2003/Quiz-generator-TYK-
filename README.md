I build a website called quiz generator with FLASK framework. The website customized in a way that it will generate 100 MCQ’s in just 2 mins.
You have so many features like writing test and getting analysis of your performance. You have assistant mode that will help or teach student 
on how to approach the specific problem. You have access to all prewritten MCQ’s. At the end of the test, you will be ranked among the student 
who wrote on the same subject. 

You have two modes
   -> Practice Mode:
        Here you will have a assistant that will help you to assist on how to solve the particular problem.
        No marks will be awarded for problem taken under practice mode. But question solved will be saved under solved question history
  -> Test Mode:
        Here you will not have any restriction and your screen will be restricted and you will enter into full screen.
        At the end you will get a detailed analysis. The analysis and solved will be stored for future reference.
        You will get assistant after completing the test to get idea on how to solve the problem. 

There are sections like 
  -> Solved section to go through all questions that we solved previously
  -> History section to get all subject wise analysis. 
  (Note: if you write more different test in one particular subject, you will get analysis for each test at the end.
  But in the History section you will have cumilative analysis. on writing 3 test on maths with total of 10 question each, you will get analysis of 
  30 question in the history section)
  -> Rank section is to stay your self as self motivated. You will get rank at end of each test.
